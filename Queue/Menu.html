               <p class="explanation"> Given an array arr[ ] of size N having elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.
Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4, arr[] = [1 3 2 4]
Output:
3 4 4 -1
Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element 
to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4 ? 
since it doesn't exist, it is -1.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 5, arr[] [6 8 0 1 3]
Output:
8 -1 1 3 -1
Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element to 
6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements 
hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it 
is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger 
element on right and hence -1. </p>

Examples: 

Input: [4, 8, 5, 2, 25]
Output: [2, 5, 2, -1, -1]
Explanation:
The first element smaller than 4 having index &gt; 0 is 2.
The first element smaller than 8 having index &gt; 1 is 5.
The first element smaller than 5 having index &gt; 2 is 2.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index &gt; 3.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index &gt; 4.

Input: [13, 7, 6, 12]
Output: [7, 6, -1, -1]

               <p class="explanation"> Given an integer K and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue
dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue
size() : Returns number of elements in queue.
front() : Finds front item.
Note: The above operations represent the general processings. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem.
Example 1:

Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5

Output: 
3 2 1 4 5

Explanation: 
After reversing the given
input from the 3rd position the resultant
output will be 3 2 1 4 5.

Example 2:
